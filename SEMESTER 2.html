    1/19/24-This week, I learned about chemical engineering, and what do chemical enginner do. I could learn difference between chemical enginnering and chemisty major. Chemcial enginner usually work at big place like factory, but chemisty major usually work at small place like LAB, they invent new drugs and pills.
     I also made a liquid with water and starch. That thing is being hard like rock if I give damage to it, but when I just let It flow it's act like liquid. I started to planning my arduino car. I'm working on my design right now.
     
     1/26/24-This week and last week, I made Non-Newtonian Fluid 2 weeks ago. Our project which is arduino car, My group and me started the CAD design of our ardunino car, and project proposal. I got inspiration with design from car Jeep, and I try my best to follow that design. Next week, I might add more detail to our car design or I change my design.

     2/5/24-Last week, I finished my CAD and start to working on the model with cardboard, and My partner start to fix the wheel for arduino car. Goals of this week are finishing the model of car, and try to take part with arduino and breadboard.

 2/13/24-This week, I will make our car can move, and edit some of shape of our arduino car I think. We can improve our arduino car, by changing the shape of it to make the breadboard and arduino are safe, it can be locked then not moving.

2/26/24-This six weeks My partner and I worked on arudino car. I designed our car as shape of box that has two holes at top parts of car so we can connect our wire to breadboard from ardino. First car the movement of wheels were so messy because sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't, so we fixed it at the second car then the second car drove as well. We make more space for wheel so it can move in second car. If we can make third car I might add more functions to our car.
