    1/19/24-This week, I learned about chemical engineering, and what do chemical enginner do. I could learn difference between chemical enginnering and chemisty major. Chemcial enginner usually work at big place like factory, but chemisty major usually work at small place like LAB, they invent new drugs and pills.
     I also made a liquid with water and starch. That thing is being hard like rock if I give damage to it, but when I just let It flow it's act like liquid. I started to planning my arduino car. I'm working on my design right now.
     
     1/26/24-This week and last week, I made Non-Newtonian Fluid 2 weeks ago. Our project which is arduino car, My group and me started the CAD design of our ardunino car, and project proposal. I got inspiration with design from car Jeep, and I try my best to follow that design. Next week, I might add more detail to our car design or I change my design.

     2/5/24-Last week, I finished my CAD and start to working on the model with cardboard, and My partner start to fix the wheel for arduino car. Goals of this week are finishing the model of car, and try to take part with arduino and breadboard.

 2/13/24-This week, I will make our car can move, and edit some of shape of our arduino car I think. We can improve our arduino car, by changing the shape of it to make the breadboard and arduino are safe, it can be locked then not moving.

2/26/24-This six weeks My partner and I worked on arudino car. I designed our car as shape of box that has two holes at top parts of car so we can connect our wire to breadboard from ardino. First car the movement of wheels were so messy because sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't, so we fixed it at the second car then the second car drove as well. We make more space for wheel so it can move in second car. If we can make third car I might add more functions to our car.

3/4/24- Last week, My teammates and I started to design our egg drop project. This project is about drop the egg from 3 floor building and protect the egg with our design. We designed like a box and glider, so glider could make box with egg fall slowly, also the bottom of our box do fuction like metal spring. I thoght those two functions could protect the egg from third floor of building. I scared of about there is nonting that can protect egg at the side, so we are thinking how to protect side of the eggs so it will not shatter.

3/13/24- This week we made egg drop project. Our team's egg drop has box and big trash bag as the parachute, so it can fall slowly and smoothly from the 3rd floor building. As the result, our egg didn't shattered.

3/29/24-This week, I started new project. This project is making boat with fan, or motor or only depend on wind. First problem that we met is how we are going to make boat floating and move to front. To solve this problem we planned to us use rubber band and straw. We are going to make rubber band powered boat. I expect out of our boat design is going to be work well even though I put the rubber band powered fan inside of it.
My goal in 10 weeks of school days before spring break is try my best and get one "B" and others as A. My favorite part of spring break was universal studio hollywood becasue when I went there with my family, we waited no more than 15min in every attractions. For example, I waited only 3 minutes for mummy and also Jurassic park, so I could ride it over 5 times as combined Jurassic and Mummy.

4/5/24-These two weeks, we worked as team. Our project was making Boat with limited materials to floating and make it move forward. Our project was good, only plan though. Basically our plan was making rubber band powered fan, We made it with rubber band, straw, and plastic cup it works well, but we didn't expect our boat is too heavy, specifically the sail. We just knew that right before testing. If I have more time and more materials, I want to try to make warship as well if I could, and make better rubber band powered band.

My favorite thing in class was I could experience new things like LED, Coding myself, and planning for my own project and make it.
my least favorite thing was noting, everything was good and fun.
THis upcoming week I want to finish my model kit because I think it will be shipped today or tomorrow, and also some other paint spray.

4/15/24-We started to make CAD for our Boat, which is our final project. The basic goal is cross the 40m swimming pool with the boat that made with limited material. Also we made the longest bridge with post-it with any method. We made our bridge by cutting post-it in half and half again then connect it. I expect for the end of the year, maybe just good grade and good relationship between friend because I don't want to mad at each other right before end of the year.

4/26/24-These two weeks, We finished to cut out the basic form of boat. We taped out boat kind of like floor plan. We are having challenge about how we tape the bottom air pocket. As my opinion both of two flat cardboard should be longer than plan. I exited about Golden bear the drill and ceremony competiton, I am not going to participate that competiton but I'm going there to watch how the other people doing.
I don't think I have overcome the stereotype that other people thinks, also I never have think about the stereotype.

5/6/24-These two weeks We focused to finish our boat. First of all, We finished to make basic shape of boat and we making bottom partss of boat right now. We set the support piece at the bottom of boat so the bottom parts could be fixed well. This weeek, I think we are going to finish our bottom air pocket and making other extra things like a flage and pedal. I'm concering about some edge of the boat because I could see the light through between of cardboard. I prefer apple juice than the orange juice, because I don't like the sour flavor of orange juice.

 5/13/24- Past week, we done with our boat. We are working on paddles right night and I believe we can done it perfectly as well. On mother's day, I had video call with my mom because she is in korea. Fortunately my family moving from korea to here on next monday. I waited for this day.

5/20/24- Last week our group worked on the mini model of our school. We measured most things from 5000 building. This week, we maybe going to finish measure and starts to make the building. During 1 year in this class, I liked learning about manufacturig and other stuff like arduino. My mindset about engineering changed after 1 year. At first time, I thought Engineering is the hard subject and like professional. I only didn't like LED and circuit because it was too confused for me. This summer, I'm going to work out and also practice spinning rifle. Plans for finals, just work hard as I could and put more afford than I think. 
Dear Mr. Poole
Thank you for teaching me about basic engineering. During I was in this class, I could learn what I like and my dream. I could mostly understand about this course even though I'm not good at English. The Engineering class was my favorite class in this course and also it helps me a lot to improve my english skill and also in the some other stuff like thinking. Thank you for 1 year Mr.Poole!. 
Thank you- Jaiden Oh
