            8/25/23 - I played video game with my friends, and I like to make website, learning how to make website in this class, because I love to making something and using computer.
            <br>
            I went site about video game. It has a descripition about their game, how to fix a problem, and download their game.
            I am going to finish my plastic model in this weekend and play league of legend with my korean friends.
            The challenge was difficult becasue I think our teamwork wasn't good.

            9/1/23-This week, I learned about mechanical engineering and start of the engineering. Last week, we did challenge that move marble with a pipe by use teamwork. This week, I made electronic machine in the house by using CAD. We started a rube goldberg machine which make building with many system to pop a balloon by rolloing baseball. I like to make shape of them with CAD. It was cool.

        9/8/23-This week, I learned about goldberg machine and they are so cool. My week going so quickly becasue there was no monday school. 
        We made a goldberg machine with group. Our goldberg machine will rolloing baseball from top of the hill and the baseball drop on the lever then other side of lever there is a ball and hit the domino by going up. the last domino hits the other ball and ball going into wedge. pulley carry it to wedge and by the wedge across two blocks and the right block hit the ballon with a sharp thing.
        Our next challenge is how to make this with cardbord and it will work.

        9/15/23-Last week, Our group finished goldberg machine with box. Our goal was pop a ballon, so we tried and tried but the two needle keep missing. First, a toy car rolling from top and hit the stick that going to drop, and the string from stick to one of side of seesaw. The seesaw touch the other seesaw which on the another box, then the shape that looks like capital L push down the wedge. when they fell the one of the side of the wedge there are needle. The needle pop the ballon.
        I made seesaw and wedge. Our teammate divide our work. For example, if I make the support fixture, other teammate make the plate for seesaw.
        If we make the things more better. I think, we could pop it, if I made my wedge better.

        9/22/23-This week, we made drow "E" and set the length and width. I made the weird E which the length is shorter than front space.  I also made floatation device with my teammate, we made paper ballon and make pence to make the things can't fell on the ballon, we dropped on the water, but the things fell through opened side, but the paper ballon was kept floated on the water.
        On the E  challenge, I could learn with out actual plan, I could make mistake, so we need actual plan for thing when I make something. On the floatation device, I could learn, You can make something with as few materials as possible.
        I could learn about the computer engineering is design, build, and test hardware components and systems, and make software.
        <hr><br>
        9/28/23-This week, I learned about computer parts. I learned about CPU,GPU, Heat sink, Fan, Hard drive, Motherboard etc. Making software interested me because it is What I want to try. We take a part of computer and combine again to see where the parts are located. 
        I learned the computer work by input and output. I learned computer is working with a lot of different parts. 
        I'm going to make my plastic model on weekend and play league.

        10/6/23-Through life science, I learned that many types of engineering are included in life science.
        I learned that various inventions are made by imitating the characteristics of living things. For example, an invention called Velcro tape was created using a plant called cocklebur.
        Our group's hands were made of cardboard, and a rubber band was wrapped around the back of each of the five fingers, about 4 inches long, with a rope wrapped around the inside. When the rope was pulled, the fingers folded, and when the strength was relaxed, they went back again. If I were to make this again, I would increase the limit on the size it can be held by dividing the fingers into each joint and making them longer. This weekend, 
        I will complete the plastic model I am making and play a game. I don't think I'll go to Homecoming because the tickets are very expensive.

        10/13/23-This week I learned about aerospace engineering. Aerospace engineering is design, develop, and test aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and missiles. Four forces on aircraft are weight, thrust, lift, and drag. I like to make something as a team in this class.

       10/20/23-This week, I learned about Aerospace Engineering. Aerospace Engineering is design, manufacturing and science of aircraft spacecraft. To aircaft can fly well, four forces have to fit, lift, thrust, weight, and drag. My group and I made plane with 2L soda bottle. We designed it as fly as airplanr. We attach long and sharp wings, and make circle hat in front. We expected fly like realplane, so we also cut some backpart like realplane, but when we launched it, it was turned around right after we launched.

        10/24/23-This week, I learned about environmental engineering. Environmental Engineering is a engineering to provide healthy water, land, and air for human. I could learn about water treatment system and about air pollution.
        I also made water filter with rock, cotton ball, and sand. Our filter was work well, we coudn't get a very clean water but we could get maybe greywater.

        11/3/23~ 11/9/23-This two weeks, I learned about electrical engineering. Electrical engineering is designing, and equipment which use any form of electricity. The four main units of electricity are Voltage, Current, Resistance, and Power. The ohms law is to know how much the voltage, resistance, and power in equation. For example, V=IxR, I=v/R R=V/I. I also learned about ciruits. I made ciruits to turn on LED, It was kind of confuse, but I could understand when we make circuits with arduino. At the first time when I start to make circuts with Tinkercad, it was really really difficult. I also could know about arduino, we put code in arduino to make LED light turn on and turn on depend on code. 
        I was interesting in circuits because I never seen that during I was going school in korea. It was new experience for me and I was surprised about there is limited in Voltage that LED could hold for turn on. I always thought LED just need power in POSITIVE and NEGETIVE.

        <li>Our 3 bridge's weigh are first one is 33.2g, second one is 42.2g, and third one is 22.2g</li>
        <li>Our bridge held 268.6g 428.5g 634.7g in a low.</li>
        <li>Our bridge's ratio of weight of bridge to weight held are the ratio of first 0ne is 8.09, second bridge is 10.15 and third one is 28.59</li>
        <li>Maybe our haviest parts of our bridge are side part because we used  most spaghetti noodles.</li>
        <li>we choose our bridges design by research. We refer to "Harren" which is one of the type of bridge.</li>
        <li>I think, our bridge worked intended.</li>
        <li>Our bridge's weakest point is maybe broken parts, when we take off the bridge from the paper, some parts are broke. We didn't expected it is going to break, but After it broke I can expect it's going to be weak point of our bridges(Three of them). .</li>
        <li>To improve our bridge, if we put some more spaghetti noodles in the floor of the bridge, to make it more safely.</li>
