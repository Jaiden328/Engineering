            8/25/23 - I played video game with my friends, and I like to make website, learning how to make website in this class, because I love to making something and using computer.
            <br>
            I went site about video game. It has a descripition about their game, how to fix a problem, and download their game.
            I am going to finish my plastic model in this weekend and play league of legend with my korean friends.
            The challenge was difficult becasue I think our teamwork wasn't good.
